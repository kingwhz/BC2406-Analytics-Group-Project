Choosing which columns to exclude:
- whether the factor can be controlled/intervened
- the factor is just a symptom at the moment of heart failure

Columns excluded to consider including (uncontrollable but useful in predicting readmission):
20 Killip.grade

164 GCS


Other things of note:
7 visit.times previous visits are not necessarily for HF/may not have concluded HF
19 NYHA = New York Heart Association
20 Killip grade is a predictor of mortality.
21 included myocardial infarction because heart attack and heart failure are different things
37 Charlson Comorbidity Index predicts the ten-year mortality for a patient who may have a range of comorbid conditions.
40-42 make up the Glasgow Coma Scale (column 164)
62 this probably refers to the number of days from the patient's admission to readmission
